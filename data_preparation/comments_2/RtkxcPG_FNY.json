{"cid": "UgzmGnGploqz2_7g_r54AaABAg", "text": "In Professor  Po-Shen Lo's method,  he used the negative of the coeficient of x. For instance in  your first example  he would have used/said (+5+u)(+5-u) =-144 whereas you used (-5+u)(-5-u) = -144. Try deriving the quadratic formula using your method. In his method where he  had x^2+Bx+C, he used (-B/2+u)(-B/2-u) = C. I am just curious as to why the professor used the opposite of the sign of the coefficient of x .. it did work for him whereas trying to derive the quadratic formula with your method did not work. Mind you, that could be my fault.
