It reminds me of my Marines friend/brother Cpl Rodd who passed away July 30, 2020 during a training exercise when the amphibious vehicle sank with him and 6 other Marines and 1 Sailor still inside. My Marine son called to let me know he was okay, Incase I had heard about the accident. I could hear in his voice that something was wrong. He proceeded to tell me about the accident and that one of his good friends was one of the Marines who went down with the amphibious vehicle. My heart broke for all the families who got that dreaded knock on the door that every military family fears. But it broke my heart even more when my Marine told me Cpl Rodd had a newborn son that will never know his daddy. I wanted to bust out in tears but I knew I had to be strong for my son who was hurting. As a mom you want to take that pain away but you learn being a military mom especially a Marine mom that all you can do is listen and be there for them day or night. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by that my Marine doesn‚Äôt think about his friend, his friends newborn son and the brothers he lost that day. \n\nThank you for your ultimate sacrifice Rest In Peace Marines and Sailor üá∫üá∏\n\nCpl.

Don‚Äôt come back when u realize how wrong u really are & take your participation trophies w u. Equality of opportunity isn‚Äôt the same thing as equality of outcome. That‚Äôs NOT a right. You have the right to try, it doesn‚Äôt mean if u fail, America is terrible. Get up & try again. PS MY RIGHT TO SPEAK IS GUARANTEED. YOUR RIGHT NOT TO BE OFFENDED, IS NOT! Try Canada.

Pearl Harbor lead to the Atomic Bomb, 9/11 lead to a complete and total take over of an entire country in 30 days, most of which was done within a few days.  We stayed to find the fuckhead who did 9/11. We killed him. Now we are there to help aid the people to fight for themselves. Everybody deserves freedom, but freedom is not free. You need to understand that. Why do you think Americans own so many guns? We had to fight for everything to gain our freedom. We know what it costs. We even killed our own brothers to fight for people who half the country didn't consider people.

It is not up to any country to try to solve the problems of the world by war.  If the ways of others disturb us, then we should apprehend the leadership of that source of disturbance, not kill off huge numbers of the population that in and of itself has no control of their leadership.  The point is it is the leadership that is corrupt, not necessarily the population.  Why kill off people who are not directly involved in ruffling our feathers?  Do we now have enough conceit that we think it tolerable to govern what religions, customs, and rights, even control, others should have?  It seems it is always religious differences combined with natural resource coveting, that  governments display their arrogance.  You cannot blame the whole population for the transgressions of their leadership.  \nIf you think that we engage in war for the protection of freedom, how many missions have you been deployed to in Uganda, to combat the genocide, or any other 3 world country for the same reason?  I'll safely bet your answer would be none.,  But on the other hand,  how many deployments have you been on to protect resources that we are trying to control or gain in the middle east?  My friend, it is all about the money.  Thats why war is such a waste.  Trying to control the worlds resources seems to be the objective of most (if not all) wars.  Although war spurs the economy by providing jobs to those who manufacture weapons, and those who sell them, and those who support troops by whatever means, it is not practical in the long run when one counts the dead.  We now fill our gas tanks with the blood of those who tried to defend that resource from us.  I now refuse to have a car, or use public transportation because of that fact. \n  I am also a Viet Nam vet, so it is not like I haven't a clue about the military.  30 years and retired in the late 80's.

There is no profit in it for your government by doing so.

Yeah that kind of war really makes a lot of sense doesn't it.  Do you even know the origin of the war between the Sunni and Shia?  Cripes, that is a war that has been going on since around 632 AD.

I do this without having to claim the false honour of murder.  I have given everything I have to those around me who are more in need than I am, without fighting them.  I find this process is not only more exemplary, but self fulfilling as part of the human race  If I see a problem I use rational thought to deal with it, not violence like most governments do to prove their superiority, to prove that by using violence others will be so afraid they will not dare to disobey even the most ridiculous whims, and therefore gain power over their populations  Providing cannon fodder to face the opposing governments is one of the most insane things a human can do, but it is accepted as somehow those who are used think they are solving a problem for their masters.

If you get far enough where you have to be deployed, and be in wars.  Once you get out how would you be able to handle your flashbacks,PTSD,reliving your night terrors, or seeing the ones you love that you are close getting killed in the line of duty? That you will be blaming yourself. As a veteran's wife, I have to tell my veteran that it is ok to cry, that it is ok to show your emotions, which in the service they train you not to show your emotions, that it isn't ok to cry. That it isn't his fault that he saw his Sargent's death, and he blames himself that it should've been him, and not his Sargent's. Unfortunately my husband isn't able to go to the VA, because another veteran has stolen my husband's benefit's. My veteran and I are currently homeless. He was promised all kinds of things, which has turn out to be a lie. He doesn't sleep days on out, and if anyone comes up behind him, he will be thrown into a major flashbacks. I have to tell him that it is ok to cry, that it is ok to feel like a human being, and that it wasn't his fault. That all his guilt should not be his, but only by our government. Why? Because he was following orders. This is what they don't want to tell you.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "E&E Wilburn", "channel": "UCLaksMbUOCZpbFPR5dNGeIA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRDk0aah2jIvH4yPn-kt2foXle7e_Upl9-wWA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

What is the issue are the 47000 sons daughters husbands and wives that were killed because of religious differences in a country half a world away from our democracy.  Catholicism, vs.Confucianism. That was the issue and has been for thousands of years in that country.  How is it that our political leaders thought we have any business in the religious wars of other countries to start with?  How is that relevant to OUR democracy?  I say fix what we have here, and we do have our own problems democracy or not, before we go out and try to solve 30,000 year old problems in other countries.  When we are actually attacked by another country, and are put into the position of having to defend what is OURS, then I would be willing to fight, but not for some religious differences which are pure crap anyway.  We are not Romans, and should not be trying to manipulate the world to our points of view, or conquer more territories for our exploitation.

Far as I know, the US hasn't been involved in any kind of crusade. Even the Vietnam war was not based on religion, again, we were backing an ally. Our current war in the middle East is also not a war over religion. It's a war on terror. Remember 9-11. How about the 2015 Paris attacks? And now, terrorism is on our own soil where terrorists groups are using propaganda to indoctrinate US citizens. Don't tell me it doesn't happen. It does.\n\nNo. We absolutely should not be putting weapons in the hands of a potential enemy. We absolutely should be focusing on our country, and I think for the most part we are. With the national debt at an all time low, and unemployment the same way. Before the US can pull out of the middle East, it needs to become self sufficient. We rely on resources coming from that area. Terrorism and war in that area devastates our trade economy. So the US is using it's power to stabilize the region. It's not a war to force religion.\n\nFurther, while I don't think you implied this, others have implied that we should de-fund our military. That's a bad idea. That is our defense. Does anybody really believe that all the countries of the nuclear treaty destroyed and stopped producing nuclear weapons? Hell, Obama tried to give nuclear weapons to Iran. That would have been an absolute disaster. We need to be ready to defend at all times. Not just in times of war. We can't de-fund our military.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Josiah M", "channel": "UC3G7tRj2OH0nquaiF5Vb2Dg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQftkx8bonXaWCh1AbsP2WIjWUQ5ZBRflWVj0AG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxdZLWidt5-_UqiI9d4AaABAg", "text": "It was nearly 30 years ago now. I didn't miss anything. Not really. Just the freedom to go and get a full English Breakfast and a cup of coffee. Back then though we didn't care about too much- it just wasn't healthy, except our unit, our company our regiment. That was the extent of our cares. Water, ammo, then food. In that order. \n\nLovely tune by this young lady. If she was my daughter I'd be very proud that she actually cares.\n\nNot many millennials do these days. My Dad used to fly Hunters in the RAF, back in the 60's. I guess it was this upbringing, but I didn't find military life hard, just an extension, like a home from home.\n\nI get it now, it's not easy for kids to relate to this. My son Max just thinks it's like a computer game. I know he knows different, but I don't want him to join. I swore on my life to my ex-wife I'd never talk about it to him and I haven't. When he asks (and he has done many times) I have to shake it off and deflect. I just said I managed the parking.\n\nNever would have happened when I was a kid. Had all my Dad's pilot friends over all the time. It was almost a given I was going in. They just wanted to know what regiment. I told them as a boy I never wanted to be a flyer.- Too much brain damage. They used to laugh. - (My Dad has since taught me to fly a light aircraft at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus- that was really sweet)\n\nThen that day arrives. I remember walking up to the gate and some corporal comes out and asks me what my excuse to live was? Welcome. Guards Depot, Pirbright. No coffee and 26 weeks of hate and discontent. - (saying that it wasn't so bad,) if you were fit and committed, the DS had you pegged in 2 days.I think in that time they had already decided who was going to pass and who was \"mag-to-grid\" (get rid). I loved it for the most part and always went above and beyond, they never had to beast me. - But they did anyway.\n\nThat first night in. 19 years old in a billet (Caterham company lines) with 20 other guys. Some of them are crying (never understood that) all of us though are quietly freaking out.\n\nThink full metal jacket USMC. Guards Depot back then was like that. DS with their peaks right in your face screaming at you. Anything you did was wrong. The bad thing was it just went on and on and on. No let up. The only real time we had to ourselves was when we were running. \n\nFrom dawn till dusk. Running. Often in full kit, usually with the longest assault course in the Army at the end of it.. Any Guardsman will tell you.. the Seven Sisters- Sandhills, one after the other. Then the worst was NBC kit training. Shit, if things got that bad where we all have to wear this gear for weeks? Well. that's the job.\n\nI look back the training seems to fly by- (it felt long and hard at the time). -That's what she said. Started with so many, just left with half at best at the end. \n\nIt seems to me that the civilian world is somewhat fascinated by that transition we undergo from Civies to Combat soldiers.\n\nTrust me on this one....You have to do it it warts and all, then still you're still a grunt. \n\nThen deployment.- That's when the fun starts.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "gilo", "channel": "UC2a7K4vEiT3rCWCdEMFMytA", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRqCDfa3xprtWbb7P5hL02mR2njYhF6-oDtfeBilw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As a former 1st Lieutenant, Scout Sniper for the 1st Special Forces Group ( Airborne), Joint Base Lewis McChord Washington State. Home of the US Army I Corps, 75th Army Ranger Battalion and all combat units, the proudest in the United States Army. Special Forces lead the way. I give the most respect and love to all my current and former brothers and sisters in uniform, get rest all, Special Forces is watching over you all and we will proudly give it all and even our very last breath for you to get back on that Transpo home and to your loving families. As we get laid to rest after getting you to your parents, your husband or wife, your children and friends who love and care for you, we'll lay at rest in a military Garrison in heaven. May all the families of fallen soldiers take solitude in the fact that their loved one gave every last drop of honor and pride to protect every single citizen of our great and powerful United States of America. We will never loose or look past your memories and will in all the units that you're from, may they celebrate your life and your service to our country! I wasn't obviously filled with enough of the honor and pride also I wasn't granted the absolute ultimate privilege of giving every single ounce and breath in order to give all back home the freedom to work a Monday thru Friday 9 to 5, Saturday and Sunday with family and friends. Taking the kids to do sports or maybe dance class. If not for the Elite and small percentage of Special Forces Operatives like myself and my brothers and sisters, living and in heaven, we are the ones who actually want to grant every single person in our great Country and all we protect, it's a Special Forces Group Sniper like me that will give every single part of my physical being, including our very last breath to get you the safety to be a family and live in peace and freedom. I can only wish with every single fiber of my being that I could have given you my life so you wake up in the morning and spend the day living life as freedom grants to you. So please remember this if a single thing from my post. I am your armor, sheild and the one who selflessly lays, I live still to this very day believing in the Army Special Forces and all Elite military units, we protect from civilians to Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors and Marines day in and out. At any time I would have been the one to tell everyone else to get to safety, as I walked into the fire, ready to die in order to provide a stopping force between the enemy and all who they threaten in any way. I will take any fight, face any threat, walk anyone under my protection to safety even if taking wounds and even as I would have been dying and getting ready for my last breath, I will still straighten my uniform, load my weapon and walk into the fire so you may enjoy life. I love my country and I would and still would die to uphold your safety and security. So sleep in peace tonight and dream of Daisy fields and new born babies. Tonight my special forces brothers and sisters are watching over you and will do everything including giving our last breath to ensure that all peoples are free, safe and stay that way! I am truly still in my heart, mind, soul and spirit, A Special Forces Operator, a scout sniper, One shot, one kill!  1st Lieutenant J.

I found out that he was a P.O.W. and that he had PTSD  from the Korean war.    He drank  very heavily  and wouldn't remember  what he did or said.    Some scary things happened at home and he decided to  make our life better and safer by leaving for good.    I felt as though he left a empty hole in our life.   And he left he had no way of getting help.   All I want was to erase all the bad memories all the bad things he went through.  Just to have the father, our daddy that my twin sister and missed out on getting to know who he really was.   Maybe in heaven I will get to know him one day.  He's been gone since 1992.   When you know your father heart is not what you see everyday but that sweet and loving man that you got a glimpse of just a couple of time's  it makes you long for just another day just to change all the pain from the war and family.     If this didn't make since I'm sorry.   It's  just something I have felt for him for a very long time.

There were times when death seemed imminent and most of us weren't afraid. For some strange reason watching this video something dawned on me. I'm sure other veterans who fought went through the same thing. What dawned on me was the dying part was easy. It's the families, especially young families with children that's the real agonizing. Being left behind not knowing if a husband or father is coming home. I can't even begin to imagine that specter of fear always nearby. \n\nWe like to think that we endured so bravely, especially when we survive. The real endurance and bravery are those we leave behind. I'm thankful that I didn't have a wife and children when I served. Being in the military, especially during war, it almost impossible to think of what our families are going through. We had to focus to much that there was no room for anything else. Our families experience the exact opposite. \n\nI would like to see people thank the families for their service, they deserve it much more than we do.\n\nThomas", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "td fisk", "channel": "UCILfpxoYvDnRdk7WfdLb9Lg", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRkc1NiJ8RXUwN5xONOrv7UrIBAIgBKAaxI9ivA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If there is one thing I learned being in the military it is that no one hates war more than a military person.  That some people are going to get killed on both sides hits you like a ton of bricks and you realize that this is all real.  It is no longer some philosophical discussion anymore.  Unfortunately sometimes it is necessary.  If you had served Wer, you would understand and would't be making such ignorant remarks about the very people who make it possible for you to exercise your rights, and even your right to be so ignorant, however just because you have the right to state these things that you do, you also have a responsibility to at least try to know what you are talking about.  You and many others seem to skip that part of it when they open their mouth.  BTW a few decades after the military action that I was involved in I am at work and I met a lady and her two kids who happen to work there also.  Got to talking to the lady and was obvious she was not from the USA so I asked her where she was from. When she told me I realized was where the military action that I was involved in and mentioned it to her.

You are now part of the tragic family of those whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom and security of this nation. As Thomas Jefferson stated  \"The tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time by the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" This American realizes that I do not live in freedom and safety for free. Better men than I, have paid for my ticket on the freedom train. May God give you comfort from your pain. I am not the brightest light bulb in the chandelier, but perhaps the reason for your son coming into this world was to save those thirty five people. If you had not had him, they would have died. We all have our rolls in this play of life, and God writes the script. We have the choice to sit it out or fulfill our roll. I leave you with a quote form an American patriot;\n\n\"Our founding fathers, here in  this country, brought about the only true revolution that has ever taken place in man's history. Every other evolution simply exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. But only here did that little band of men so advanced beyond their time that the world has never seen their like since, evolve the idea that you and I have within ourselves the God-given right and ability to determine our own destiny. But freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. The only way they can inherit the freedom we have  known is if we fight for it, protect it, defend it and then hand it to them with the well thought lessons of how they must do the same. And if you and I don't do this, then you and I may well spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in America when men were free.\"   Ronald Reagan 40th President of The United States", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "WG 1947", "channel": "UCXXiJXFLm2m0epw-UC6SI0g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRFUR3KcgHa9OAUY4UauwVNve6jJKUVdCa5ZQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Every time I hear that a soldier was killed I sing a sad sad and dedicate it to that person and look up to the roof of my school as if I'm looking up to heaven. The US Army is one of the branches I dedicate and Marines is another but basically I always dedicate my singing to every branch of the Military.

Thanks for keeping my brothers in your thoughts & song.\n\nAs soldiers we go where we are told to go and we do our duty to the best that we can. We do not pick the fight, we just fight it. Our leaders send us, our fellow countrymen allow it and our blood is shed and our lives are lost.\nThe loss of a loved ones life is a sorrowful thing. I salute my brothers lost lives and the wounded. I am also saddened for the great loss of non-combatants for I'm sure their loved ones miss them as well.\nMaybe one day our leaders will fight their own battle or lead us into battle from the front to prove it to be a worthy fight or better yet give us a righteous fight with the intention of truly wining. Till that day us pawns will keep on fighting each other and sadness will fill the hearts of many on all sides.\n\nFor Christ, Christian Family and Christendom,\nThe CaptainÔªø", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Civil Defense News Network (a service of the Protestant Church of America)", "channel": "UCowQuxNSnjmYzA6-zcyACtA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQy6KFCO9Rp4NRY6lsOk6MWJn6xg8rKUHRX1DKP=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
