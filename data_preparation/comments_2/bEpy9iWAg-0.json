I don't need all this extra pickle juice.\nThe jar is literally 50% bigger than it needs to be and is also annoying to try and fit in our refrigerator door.\nWRZ  2021-08-08", "time": "17 hours ago", "author": "Bill Zardus", "channel": "UCFHNfG8zMZMxknVpBJuHZqw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTQYKqFIrqdMm1dM9LzYTh-TTcDnQfbzqs8hQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
